Either wild type or par-4 mutant embryos were examined, after 24-hour incubation at 25C (the non-permissive temperature for the it47 allele of par-4). Anterior is to the left in all images. The data presented here reveals previously not shown data that depicts CYB-3 as asymmetrically distributed at the 4-cell stage. These data further support reported findings in Michael, 2016. There is more CYB-3 in the AB cell relative to its sister P1. In 4-cell embryos there is more CYB-3 in the EMS cell relative to its sister, P2. Thus, during P-lineage divisions, CYB-3 is asymmetrically distributed such that the somatic precursor receives more than its germline precursor sister cell. This asymmetry is abolished in par-4 mutant embryos, where all blastomeres contain equivalent amounts of CYB-3.</description></descriptions><volume>3</volume><journal>microPublication Biology</journal><e-issn>2578-9430</e-issn><file>W27P4P.pdf</file><rightsList><rights>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</rights><rightsURI>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode</rightsURI></rightsList></resource>
